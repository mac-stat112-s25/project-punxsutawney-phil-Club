# The Truth Behind Groundhog Accuracy: A Data-Driven Study

## Team Members
- Joey Gebin  
- Zeke Friendly  
- Mayande Mamba

## Project Description

We explore the last 130 years of Groundhog Day predictions, analyzing:

- How accurate groundhogs have been in predicting winter or spring.  
- How often different groundhogs agree in their forecasts.  
- Whether factors like **location**, **groundhog identity**, or **time period** affect prediction accuracy.  
- A comparison between **groundhog-based** and **non-groundhog-based** forecasts.

## Project Inspiration

Our curiosity was sparked by the folklore surrounding Groundhog Day.  
We wanted to use data to assess whether there’s any statistical merit behind groundhog predictions and what patterns—if any—emerge from them.
